# About this project
This is a memory game made in a single HTML file (and a few other asset files)
using vanilla Javascript and inline css, just for fun.

## How to run
1. Download the source or clone the repo:

   `git clone https://github.com/JorgeLDB/memory-game.git`

2. Go to the repo folder.

   `cd memory-game`

3. Run an http server. I like to do this using the python one:

   `python -m http.server`

4. Open the server in your browser. The python http server uses by default the
   port 8000, so the link would be
   [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/).

5. Have fun.
